# About Dataset

## Context

The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat.

This dataset is provided as a subset of photos from a much larger dataset of 3 million manually annotated photos.

The dataset was developed as a partnership between Petfinder.com and Microsoft.

# Cat and Dog Image Classifier

## Introduction

Briefly explain the goal of the project: building a machine learning model to classify images as either cats or dogs.

Mention the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a type of deep learning model well-suited for image classification tasks.

## Tools and Libraries

TensorFlow and Keras: Explain that TensorFlow is the deep learning framework used, and Keras is a high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow.

## Model Architecture

Describe the architecture of the CNN used for the classification task.
Input Layer: 64x64 pixel RGB images.

Convolutional Layers: Three sets of convolutional and max-pooling layers to capture image features.

Flatten Layer: Flatten the output for input to fully connected layers.
Fully Connected Layers: Dense layers for making predictions.

Output Layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification (cat or dog).

## Data Preprocessing

ImageDataGenerator: Briefly explain the use of ImageDataGenerator for real-time data augmentation during model training.

Training and Test Sets: Mention the organization of the dataset into 'training_data' and 'test_data' directories.

## Model Training

Explain the model compilation with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

Describe the training process using the fit() function with the training and test datasets.

## Model Evaluation

Mention the evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, used to assess the model's performance.

## Saving the Model
Explain how to save the trained model for future use.

## Prediction
Briefly mention how to load the saved model and use it for making predictions on new images.
Provide a simple code snippet for making predictions on a single image.
